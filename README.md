Adobe Experience Platform SDK Expo Plugin

## About this project

This project is a wrapper around the Adobe Experience Platform React Native SDKs for Expo projects.

## Who should use this plugin?

**This plugin is intended for developers who are building Expo project from scratch and want to use the Adobe Experience Platform SDKs in their projects.**

If you already have an existing Expo project and have already installed the Adobe Experience Platform RN SDKs, you should not use this plugin.

If you have a bare React Native project, you should not use this plugin. You can see this [guide](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-react-native?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for more information on how to install the Adobe Experience Platform SDKs in a bare React Native project.
